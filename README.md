I'm a newly 𝗙𝗹𝘂𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿, but "*old dog*" in mobile apps development, with 20+ years of professional experience with building **cross-platform B2B & B2E applications** for Android, iOS and the Web.

Since 2020, I'm totally in love and 100% focused on **Flutter & Dart**, __my great bet for the future__, and I've decided to start humbly contributing and helping within the _**Flutter Community**_, with code, packages, libraries, and my background in the mobile software industry... 💙🚀

Other than that, I am proficient in **Java** and have been a _consultant_ and _instructor_ for **J2EE projects and Java programming** @[BEA SYSTEMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEA_Systems) (**Oracle** acquisition in 2008).

**Talking about Personal Stuffs**

- 🛑 I'm not a Google Expert | nor a Content Creator | nor a Google Advocate
- 💻 I'm a Mobile Apps Creator 📱 Full Stack Engineer 🛠 Software Instructor 🤓 Tech Business Dreamer 💸
- 💙 I do believe Flutter is the new and real "*Write Once Run Everywhere*", the old Java motto!! Remember?! 🤔
- 🇫🇷 I am from France but I have been living in Spain 🇪🇸 for 20+ years
- 💬 Ask me about anything, I'll be happy to help you!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been developping mobile apps with "*Jurassic-technos*" like **J2ME**, **PersonalJava** and **BlackBerry SDK**!!
